This app incorporates the NASA api to get random astronomy pictures for the day.

The results are formatted into cards with an image title, add to favorites, description, date and copyright information.

The images are lazy loaded in order to improve performance.

If we click on an image, we can view the full resolution version of that image in a new tab.

We also have the ability to add images to our favorites page, accomplished using local storage.

At our favorites page, we can view the images that we saved and have the option to remove a favorite and the page reloads from the top of the page.
